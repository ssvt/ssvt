# **Hi, I'm Sergey**ü§ù

## I'm a java developer and radio electronics engineer
I am a radio electronics engineer by education, and I have always had to write either in assembler or in C for microcontrollers,
and only for the last 4 years I have been writing in java. But the principles of building algorithms and complex structures 
are the merit of 15 years of old school experience. 
I love to deal with complex and unusual projects
